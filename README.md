# BusMall

This repository contains the following files: index.html, app.js, style.css, css_reset.css, README.md, user_stories.md, and a folder titled, "assets."

The purpose of this project is to create a website for BusMall that displays images of products to a focus group, allowing them to choose items that they are most likely to purchase. Three random images are randomly generated for the user, and the user must click on one of the three to indicate which item they are most likely to purchase. After 25 total clicks, the results of the user's selection are rendered below the images.

This site will provide BusMall with market analysis that will aid in determining what products to include in their catalog.
