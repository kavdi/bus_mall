# BusMall

This repository contains the following files: index.html, app.js, style.css, css_reset.css, README.md, user_stories.md, and a folder titled, "assets."

The purpose of this project is to create a website for BusMall that displays images of products to a focus group, allowing them to choose items that they are most likely to purchase.

This site will provide BusMall with market analysis that will aid in determining what products to include in their catalog.
